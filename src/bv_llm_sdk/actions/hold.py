"""Hold the vehicle's position (Loiter / Hold mode).

Every action in this package is self-contained: it opens its own link, talks
to PX4 directly, and closes it. Nothing is hidden in a shared helper, so this
file is the whole story and a new action can start as a copy of it.

Four things about this link are not obvious. Read them before writing a new
action, because getting any of them wrong fails in a way that looks like
"PX4 is broken" rather than like a bug here.

1. We must speak first. PX4 runs in Docker and only 18570/udp is published
   inbound, so PX4 cannot reach the host until it learns our address from a
   packet we send. Hence the heartbeat loop below, not mavutil's
   wait_heartbeat(), which listens without ever sending.

2. Every send needs an explicit destination. A udpin socket writes back to
   whatever address it last heard from, and that is unset until telemetry
   arrives, so conn.mav.*_send() would drop the first packet on the floor.
   Use conn.port.sendto(msg.pack(conn.mav), PX4_ADDR).

3. Windows turns an ICMP port-unreachable from an earlier send into a
   ConnectionResetError on the *next* recv. On a connectionless socket that
   only means nobody was listening yet, so catch it and let our own deadline
   decide when to give up.

4. LOCAL_PORT must be 14550 in every action. PX4 SITL's GCS instance
   transmits to that port and latches the remote it learned, so an action
   that binds a different port hears nothing back. Do not change it here
   without changing it everywhere.
